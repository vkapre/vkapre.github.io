    - title: Postdoctoral Researcher
      institution: School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University
      year: 2025
      description:
        - Execute an industry funded project with Juggerbot3D to develop additive manufacturing
          capabilities for fiber reinforced thermoset resin systems.
        - Support the Composites Additive Manufacturing and Simulation Consortium (CAMS) at the
          Composites Manufacturing and Simulation Center through simulation, characterization, and
          validation for printing with various thermoplastic composites.
        - Prepare reports and publications that will be submitted to archival journals, contributing to the
          preparation of funding proposals.
    - title: Ph.D. Thesis 
      institution: School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Purdue University
      year: 2020 - 2024
      description:
        - Modeled the flow of cylindrical pellets in a single screw extruder using LIGGGHTS, a discrete
          element method opensource code implement in C++, and used Paraview for pellet trajectory
          visualization.
        - Validated pellet motion in the solid-conveying zone of a single screw extruder for starve-fed
          extrusion of 40% CF-PPS by building an extruder system with acrylic barrel for visual pellet
          tracking.
        - Created a sequentially coupled discrete element â€“ finite element (DEM-FEM) framework to
          capture heat-transfer and melting of a single pellet in ABAQUS based on contact information
          obtained from LIGGGHTS.
        - Extended melting and crystallization kinetics model of semi-crystalline 40% CF-PPS and
          implemented in ABAQUS heat-transfer simulations through user-subroutine UMATHT.
        - Developed analytical models based on beam theory for partially molten pellet deformation and
          fiber-breakage in the melting zone of a single screw extruder.

    - title: Graduate Research Assistant
      institution: Composites Manufacturing & Simulation Center (CMSC)
      year: 2019 - 2023
      description:
        - Collaborated with the additive manufacturing team to develop material cards for short-fiber
          reinforced polymer composites such as 50% CF-PPS, 25% CF-PESU, and 25% CF-PSU to enable
          simulations.
        - Performed various experiments to characterize the thermo-mechanical and microstructural
          properties of orthotropic viscoelastic materials used in extrusion deposition additive
          manufacturing (EDAM)
        - Wrote MATLAB codes to measure and obtain the fiber-orientation tensor and fiber-length
          distribution from optical micrographs using the image-processing toolbox.
        - Validated residual stresses and deformation of additively manufactured geometries using
          Additive-3D, an in-house physics-based simulation software.
        - Investigated the effect of printing parameters such as bead aspect ratio, layer height, and stretching
          ratio on the effective mechanical properties of printed parts and validated
