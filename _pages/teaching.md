I delivered three lectures for ME323 (Mechanics of Materials) which included explain new concepts,
solving problems in class and taking quizzes. During my PhD and Masters, I was a Teaching Assistant for
three courses in Aerospace Engineering (AAE 553, AAE 555, AAE 204) where I conducted office hours,
and helped in grading homework and proctoring exams. For AAE 590 (Advanced Manufacturing of
Composite Materials), I helped in the lab by setting up experiments and guiding students through various
composite manufacturing experiments. In the math department, I taught recitation lectures to three
sections of first year undergraduate students for MA 165 (Analytical Geometry & Calculus – I).
