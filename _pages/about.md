I am an engineering researcher specializing in modeling and simulation of advanced composite materials and polymer processes. My Ph.D. thesis involved simulating the flow of fiber-reinforced pellets during single screw extrusion, using multi-physics models to capture pellet motion, melting, deformation, and fiber damage. I have extensive experience with FEA, material characterization, and beam theory-based analytical models.

I am passionate about solving complex engineering problems and translating technical concepts into practical solutions. I enjoy applying both analytical and creative thinking to optimize manufacturing processes and enhance material performance.

Other than work, I love gardening! And occasionally hiking, reading (currently Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky), and writing (mostly to dump whatever is on my mind). I would love to connect!
